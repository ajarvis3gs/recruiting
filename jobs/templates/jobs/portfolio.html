High demands from the business unit and an overall lack of time to correctly design and develop new features led to a series of poor decisions that ultimately made the management of these web applications impossible. Besides developing an environment to consolidate existing web applications, the client desired recommendations for a standardized core set of technologies as well as introduce documentation, testing, best practices and coding standards to the development team.</p>

                                        <p>Performed a thorough analysis of the legacy applications and conducted numerous rapid design sessions with end users, business unit members, support staff, and development staff to ensure all needs were documented before implementing the new development environment. As a result of the analysis and design sessions, we recommended building a Java-based web environment utilizing standard technologies such as Apache/Tomcat, Struts/Tiles, JSP, Spring, and JSF. We also recommended a standardized set of development tools such as Eclipse IDE for project development, ANT for project building, JUnit for testing, JMeter for performance benchmarking, and tools such as JDepend and PMD to enforce coding conventions throughout the development team.</p>

We produced a proof of concept to demonstrate the proper use of all of the recommended tools and best practices. Due to the overall success and acceptance of the pilot application, we were asked to plan and lead the implementation of the Web application and target environments.</p>

                                        <p>Performed a thorough analysis of the legacy database systems and conducted numerous rapid design sessions with end users, support staff, and development staff to ensure all needs were documented before implementing the new production environment. As a result of the analysis and design sessions, we recommended a development strategy that would not only mitigate the transition to the new web-based application for end users but also for development staff team members. Our recommendations included scalability to ensure the environment could support increasing demand and usage over the next several years.</p>

                                        <p>Utilized our extensive background in software design, project planning, systems architecture and web based technologies to create a new Microsoft-based environment that enabled the Department of Corrections to adopt a formal case management solution. Due to the overall success of the project, the Department is now working to leverage their infrastructure for several other initiatives.</p>

                                        <h3 class="person-title">Industry: Financial</h3>

                                        <p>Designed, developed and integrated an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) system which connected the consumer credit organization at a National US Bank to various fulfillment vendors related to home equity loans.  This system integrated a 3090 Mainframe using CICS and ACAPS with windows and linux systems over frame relay WAN connections and the Internet. </p>

                                        <p>The application became a turn key service hosted in geographically separated Datacenter Facilities. As part of the service creation, we analyzed performance and utilization needs for the national operations and selected, procured, installed, configured and maintained the required hardware and software.  We worked with the financial institutions architecture and security teams to implement the system according to the customers needs and requirements.</p>

                                        <p>The service allowed lenders in response to a consumers home equity loan application to order various property related products from Flood, Title and Appraisal companies through out the United States.  The lenders service orders are transmitted electronically through the RVOMS service, over the internet and placed in the service providers order entry systems.  When the service provider had completed the work ordered by the lender the resulting property report and associated data elements are then transmitted back through the service and into the lenders credit application decision process.</p>

                                        <p>The lenders orders and the vendor’s reports were stored electronically within the RVOMS data warehouse, visibility to the transactions was provided through the use of a web portal.  Lenders and vendors logged into the service and made use of the Vendor Order Management interface for customer service and vendor management metrics.  The portal was developed using Java NIO, Apache web servers, Tomcat application containers, Sybase Enterprise server on Linux, JSP pages, and Hibernate for the persistence layer.  Lenders gained a layer of security by consolidating the number of potential external connection points to the single hosted application service.  Where possible the MISMO xml specifications were utilized for web service transactions.</p>

                                        <p>The service is hosted within private data centers; multiple instances of the service were required for Development, Test, and User Acceptance.  The data centers allocate customers environments depending upon the number of systems required, the rack space required, power requirements, and public or private network access required.  Ongoing customer support was included with the service.</p>

                                        <p>The service required all data between the lenders mainframe system and the vendors systems be normalized and persisted.  In most cases data transmissions will be converted from the lenders systems data format and machine architecture to network form for transmission to the vendors.  </p>

                                        <p>The reverse process is then performed between the vendor’s data processing systems and the service or lenders systems.</p>

                                        <p>Engaged with our clients architecture and systems team to produce an integrated DevOps pipeline.  The target platform was Amazon Web Services.  A number of open source tools and products were utilized in conjunction with Amazon services.  The end product was a complete API Infrastructure centered on Kong API Gateway.   We started with Vagrant, virtualbox and chef to produce VM's capable of running Cassandra and the Kong API Gateway.  We then added packer and produced AMI's registered with AWS.  Using cloudformation the AMI's were activated within VPC's, complete with Elastic Load Balancers, Autoscaling groups and rolling upgrades.</p>

                                        <p>The mobile web services project, utilizing agile software development methods in a continuous integration environment, kicked of during 2013.   Our team worked with the clients architecture team to expose several existing business services through a common software layer. The software developed was Multi-tenant capable, and could be hosted for clients as a set of services or deployed into a clients existing environment. Each component layer of the software was carefully orchestrated and deploy-able as a set of jar files. The design allowed jars to be integrated easily within existing customer deployments. The services exposed were interesting and followed well established best practices. Authentication, Authorization, User Profile, Branding, and numerous corporate payment services allowed an Iphone application to display multiple site brands and features based upon a customer, the users permissions within the back end applications and the device being used.</p>

                                        <p>While engaged with the team, we were able to implement an HTML5 video component for the kentico cms and vimeo a popular video hosting site. The videos are played within a fancybox implementation.</p>
